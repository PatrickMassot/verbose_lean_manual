Proof:
  Let's first prove that n ^ 2 is even ⇒ n is even
  · Let's prove the contrapositive: ¬n is even ⇒ ¬n ^ 2 is even
    It suffices to prove that n is odd ⇒ n^2 is odd
    Assume hyp : n is odd
    Since n is odd we get k such that hk : n = 2 * k + 1
    Since n = 2 * k + 1 it suffices to prove that (2 * k + 1)^2 is odd

/- Let’s see how to introduce ad hoc lemmas for students.

Here we tell students that `v₂` is the function sending an integer to
the exponent of 2 in it prime factors decomposition. There are only
two facts needed about this function

`∀ p : ℤ, v₂ (p^2) is even`

`∀ p : ℤ, p ≠ 0 ⇒ v₂ (2*p) = v₂ p + 1`

We also registered a bunch of lemmas about even and odd numbers
(that we can list for students).
